Dear %%first_name%%,

The 2019 Louisiana Association of School Executives (LASE) conference is here! We can't wait to meet you, so please stop by the Voyager Sopris Learning® booth and learn how LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) is helping teachers learn the science of reading and gives them the tools to teach language and literacy skills to every student.

We also will be offering demonstrations of our LETRS literacy professional development, which helped educators at Rapides Parish Schools in Alexandria, LA improve the reading levels and skills of their K–3 students.

“The one question we had to answer was, ‘Do our teachers really understand the reading process?’ For us, LETRS was the missing piece, especially with the shift in education where so many teachers are coming from nontraditional backgrounds to teach. It’s imperative to us—teachers need to know how students learn to read to be able to effectively teach reading.”

—Kimberly Bennett, Executive Assistant Superintendent, Rapides Parish Schools

We look forward to seeing you in Baton Rouge!

Please contact me to learn more about LETRS and raise K–12 literacy achievement for all learners.
